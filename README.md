# rust-rps
Simple rock paper scissors app in rust, its my second ever rust project so no bulli plz.

# It works on a very simple basis:
- Your score is stored from 0.
- the game repeats itself in a loop while you don't type in 0 or use Ctrl+C/Ctrl+D.
- If your score gets down to -1, then the loop breaks and you get ratio'd by the terminal.
